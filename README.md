# KeCoin_USTC_CausalML_Challenge

## Dependencies:

- python >= 3.7
- tesorflow-gpu >= 2.0 
- numpy
- tqdm
- utils
- pandas
- sklearn

## Before

First, put Task_1_dataset and Task_3_dataset in same file path with Task_3_dataset and Task_4_dataset.

Solutions of task3 and task4 are based on our previous work published in KDD'21

## For task1: 
first, go to task1/:

## For task2: 


## For task3: 
first, go to task3/:

`cd task3`

then, preparing the data:

`python data_pre.py`


`python data_save.py 200`

`python data_3.py 200`

then, training the model and making predictions:

`python train_lpkt.py 0`

`python test4task3.py {model_name}`

finally, prepare submission:

`python processing.py`

## For task4: 
first, go to task4/:

`cd task4`

then, preparing the data:

`python data_pre.py`


`python data_save.py 200`

`python data_4.py 200`

then, training the model and making predictions:

`python train_lpkt.py 0`

`python test4task4.py {model_name}`
