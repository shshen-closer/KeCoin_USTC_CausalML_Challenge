# KeCoin_USTC_CausalML_Challenge

## Dependencies:

- python >= 3.7
- tesorflow-gpu >= 2.0 
- numpy
- tqdm
- utils
- pandas
- sklearn
- 
## Hardware:
NVIDIA RTX 3090 * 1
or other GPU with more than 20G memory

## Before

First, put Task_1_dataset and Task_3_dataset in same file path with Task_3_dataset and Task_4_dataset.

Solutions of task3 and task4 are based on our previous work published in KDD'21

## For task1: 
**To repeat our results:**

first, go to task1/:

`cd task1`

then, 

`python test_all_private.py runs_9_3`

`python meaning.py`

**To train from start:**

first, go to task1/:

`cd task1`

then, 

`python train_all.py`

then, 

`python test_all_private.py runs`

`python meaning.py`

**The output adj_matirx.npy is our result**



## For task2: 


## For task3: 
first, go to task3/:

`cd task3`

then, preparing the data:

`python data_pre.py`


`python data_save.py 200`

`python data_3.py 200`

then, training the model and making predictions:

`python train_lpkt.py 0`

`python test4task3.py {model_name}`

finally, prepare submission:

`python processing.py`

## For task4: 
first, go to task4/:

`cd task4`

then, preparing the data:

`python data_pre.py`


`python data_save.py 200`

`python data_4.py 200`

then, training the model and making predictions:

`python train_lpkt.py 0`

after training, the model file will be stored in runs/, 1665554163 was used for our submission, you can also used the new trained model.

**To repeat our results:**

`python test4task4.py 1665554163`

**To train from start:**

`python test4task4.py {model_name}`

**The output cate_estimate.npy is our result. Noting it is hard to get totally same results due to we choose different records for testing every time, but the deviation is acceptable**
