# KeCoin_USTC_CausalML_Challenge

## Dependencies:

- python >= 3.7
- tesorflow-gpu >= 2.0 
- numpy
- tqdm
- utils
- pandas
- sklearn

## Usage

First, put Task_1_dataset and Task_3_dataset in same file path with Task_3_dataset and Task_4_dataset.

Solutions of task3 and task4 are based on our previous work published in KDD'21

```
Specifically, for task3: 
first, go to task3/:
`cd task3`

then, preparing the data:
`python data_pre.py`


`python data_save.py 200`

`python data_3.py 200`

then, training the model and making predictions:
`python train_lpkt.py 0`

`python test4task3.py {model_name}`

finally, prepare submission:
`python processing.py`
